\begin{abstract}
This comprehensive research report presents an in-depth analysis of Yeshiva University's digital presence compared to five peer institutions: Columbia University, New York University (NYU), Brandeis University, Rutgers University, and the University of Maryland. The study encompasses detailed social media analytics, engagement metrics, content strategy analysis, and qualitative research on brand voice and design elements.

Key findings indicate significant opportunities for growth in digital engagement, particularly in emerging platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. The research reveals a substantial gap in social media presence compared to peer institutions, with YU's Instagram following at 15,000 versus a peer average of 150,000. However, this gap presents immediate opportunities for growth through strategic platform adoption and content optimization.

The report concludes with actionable recommendations for enhancing Yeshiva University's digital presence while maintaining its institutional values and academic excellence. Implementation strategies are provided with specific timelines, resource requirements, and success metrics.
